1. Make an array of objects that takes 2 values 1. index/id 2.increment boolian

increment will control a variable called counter / amount

if increment positive then counter++ else vice versa

create an array that has id amount and send it to cart component
check if array item already exists
if yes counter++ else counter = 1
if counter = 0 delete that item
Finally sum up all the counter/ amount and show it on Total items
